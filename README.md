I have built sentiment analsysis models on the Yelp Reviews.

## Yelp Data Description :

* The Yelp dataset is available in json files and consists of review data files and business data files for the scope of this project.
* The review data files include reviews with attributes such as review id, business id, business name, the review text, star rating, etc. 
* The Business data files include attributes such as business name, address,business id,etc.

## Data Exploration 

The sample data is in unstructured format on which I have performed analysis on the basis of three factors :
* Distribution of reviews across Star ratings
* Distribution of reviews across states
* Distribution of reviews across postal codes

### Star Rating:
