Yelp Reviews Dataset

Explored the Yelp-review dataset and pre-processed the reviews by using stemming and lemmatization.

Using Bing, NRC, and AFinn dictionaries and a combined dictionary, built Random Forests, SVMs, and Na√Øve Bayes models to classify the reviews based on the word sentiment into positive and negative.
