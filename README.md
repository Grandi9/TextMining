I have built a sentiment analsysis models on the Yelp Reviews.
Using the star ratings of the reviews, the sentiment lables are assigned. 

Yelp Data Description :

The Yelp dataset is available in json files and consists of review data files and business data files for the scope of this project.
The review data files include reviews with attributes such as review id, business id, business name, the review text, star rating, etc. The Business data files include attributes such as business name, address,business id,etc.
We are considering restaurant reviews for which the data has been pre-processed to get the star rating,review text,business type.
For this assignment a sample of original dataset is used with approximately 47k reviews by each user.
The sample data contains 26 attributes which will help us perform text mining on the reviews.
